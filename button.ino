/*
  Web Server Demo
  thrown together by Randy Sarafan
 
 A simple web server that changes the page that is served, triggered by a button press.
 
 Circuit:
 * Ethernet shield attached to pins 10, 11, 12, 13
 * Connect a button between Pin D2 and 5V
 * Connect a 10K resistor between Pin D2 and ground
